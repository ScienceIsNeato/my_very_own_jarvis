        Generate lyrics for a {target_duration}-second song based on the following story.
        The lyrics should be:
        - Each line takes 8-12 seconds to sing naturally with proper phrasing
        - Each line should be 8-10 syllables for natural pacing
        - No repetition of lines
        - Focus on the key themes, emotions, and narrative elements
        - Suitable for a trailer or closing credits
        - Must clearly reflect the story's themes and content

        For reference:
        - A 20-second song should have 2-3 lines
        - A 30-second song should have 3-4 lines
        - A 45-second song should have 4-5 lines

        Story:

            "lyrics": "the generated lyrics here"
        }}

        The lyrics should capture the essence and themes of the story while being memorable and fitting the time constraint.
